## Baby Shark Web
<sup> Bordeianu Ana Maria & Popa Cosmin </sup>

This web application allows authenticated users—such as families, couples, or nannies—to manage child care resources from infancy to puberty. It covers feeding and sleep schedules, medical history, and enables the uploading of multimedia (photos, videos, audio) into a feed where friends can be tagged. Users can also track the relationships between children by selecting specific friends (e.g., cousins, kindergarten/school classmates). The app provides an overview of important moments captured for each friend. All functionalities are exposed through a REST API and secured with JWT token-based authentication.

Exposed to: HTTP, JavaScript, noSQL, HTML5, CSS, MongoDB, Mongoose
