The application will target the following: feeding schedule, sleep schedule, various multimedia resources (photos, videos, audio recordings,...) regarding the child's development, medical history, relationship with other children (e.g., cousins, kindergarten/school classmates) etc. The application will provide a chronological view of the most important moments captured for each child. The system functionalities will also be exposed through a REST API.
