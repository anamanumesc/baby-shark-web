REST = representational state transfer

CORS = cross origin resource sharing

API = application programming interface - connects apps together

HTTP = hypertext transfer protocol
is responsible for request-response cycle for the user and the server

HTTP message:

*start line
*headers
*body

Start line -> Method (GET, POST etc) URI (Uniform Resource Identifier exemplu /api/login) HTTP version
Headers -> name-value pairs like host, accept, keep-alive

For replies, the start line only contains the HTTP version and the server code (200 - ok, 400- user error, 500 - server error)

CORS = cross origin resource sharing
(basically you cant request data from one server to another)
same origin policy	

DOM = document object model

AJAX = asynchronous javascript and xml - used for getting information on a page piece by piece
asynchronous = communicate with the server without reloading
JavaScript communicates with the server via XHR = xml http request

Promises = objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
await = pauses the execution of an asynchronous function until a promise is settled (success or failure)
!!When you fetch something, it always returns a promise
.then(res  => res.json())  response (ex. res.ok = success)
	.then(data => console.log(data)) prints out the body
.catch(error =>) -very rarely happens because 404 not found for example is still successful
